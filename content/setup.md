## Getting the Tools

While we have been using the verification tool chain for more than 5 years at [BlueRock Security](https://bluerock-io.github.io/formal-methods), a public release is still in a beta stage.

The automation is available under commercial and academic licenses.
If you're interested in using the tools, please [contact us](mailto:contact@skylabs-ai.com?subject=FM Tools) to determine the right route.

We want to [hear your feedback](contributing.md), it is the way we build better products.
