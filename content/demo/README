SkyLabs BRiCk Examples
=============================

This package contains demonstrations of using the SkyLabs BRiCk framework for
verifying simple C++ code. The examples are focused on techniques and are often
expressed in somewhat "toy" bits of code.

Guidelines
-------------

Examples should contain a `README.md` file that describes the content of the
example and the intended audience. If you think that an example is
insufficiently documented, please create an MR or file a bug.
