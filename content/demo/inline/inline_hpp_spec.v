#[local] Open Scope Z_scope.

(*| In in some instances, the most natural reasoning principle for a
function is simply to unfold it. In this case, we can use the `inline`
specification to the `cpp.spec` command to generate an specification
for the function automatically.

```coq
cpp.spec "foo()" as foo_inline inline.
```

:::warn
Marking a function for inlining in the logic effectively requires
re-verifying the fuction body every time that the function is called.
This can be expensive, so large functions, and functions that are called
may times should probably use explicitly written function specifications.
:::
:::info
On the other hand, marking a function for inlining in the C++ program using
the `inline` keyword **does not** affect the verification.
